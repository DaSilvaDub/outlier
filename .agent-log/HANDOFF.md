`394138e` — fix(pack): restore projection_side_conflict flag on audit-only rows

## PR
[#194](https://github.com/DaSilvaDub/outlier/pull/194) — `claude/inspiring-fermat-xuehxu` → master

## Files Touched
- `outlier_scrapers/pack_selection.py` — #190 (`26f257e`) moved the
  `projection_side_conflict` check out of `_apply_quality_and_signal_flags` into a
  `build_row` discard; `c25a0a0` then exempted audit-only fallback projections from that
  discard. The combination left audit-only rows with *no* signal: the row is kept, but the
  flag was no longer appended anywhere in the codebase. Restored the original block. It is
  only reachable by rows the upstream discard deliberately kept, so real projections still
  drop at `build_row` and only the audit-only case falls through to the flag. The flag stays
  informational (not in `DISQUALIFYING_DQ_FLAGS`), matching its pre-#190 role. Also re-uses
  the `market_type_upper` local that #190 orphaned (ruff `F841`).
- `tests/test_pack.py` — `test_audit_only_projection_side_conflict_is_kept_but_flagged`,
  placed alongside #190's two `_discarded_upstream_` tests so the trio pins all three
  outcomes.

## Evidence
Same card as `test_league_average_so_projection_is_audit_only` (OVER 5.5, league-average SO
mean 4.95 — below the line, so it opposes the OVER):

| revision | `data_quality_flags` |
|---|---|
| `82569cd` (pre-#190) | `projection_side_conflict` |
| `c25a0a0` (master) | *(empty)* |
| this branch | `projection_side_conflict` |

## Verification
- `pytest` — 1124 passed / 43 skipped, identical to the pre-change baseline. All 67 failures
  and 29 collection errors are `ModuleNotFoundError` (`sqlalchemy` ×most, plus `google`,
  `anthropic`, `openai`, `dateutil`).
- **Sandbox limitation (recurring):** pypi.org and files.pythonhosted.org return **403** from
  the egress proxy (also via `--proxy $HTTPS_PROXY`), so project deps cannot be installed.
  `pytest`/`ruff`/`mypy` are present as standalone uv tools. A stdlib-only `structlog` shim
  under the scratchpad unblocked 41 of the 48 collection errors. **`tests/test_pack.py` is
  sqlalchemy-blocked, so the new test could not run locally — CI is the authority.** Its
  assertions were validated by driving `build_row` directly through a `pack_selection`-only
  import path, and the pre-#190 comparison was run in a detached worktree at `82569cd`.
- `ruff check` — 20 → 19 errors (the `F841` is resolved). Remaining 19 are pre-existing
  unused imports in `scratch.py`/`script.py`/`append_feedback.py` and two test files; ruff is
  not in CI.
- `mypy outlier_scrapers` — unchanged: 3 pre-existing `arg-type` false positives
  (`schema.py:256`, `probable_pitchers.py:95`, `game_totals.py:1045` — all wrapped in
  `try/except (ValueError, TypeError)`) plus one missing-stub note.

## Next Steps / Open Items
- Review and merge PR #194.
- **Still open (from 2026-09-25):** `outlier_nfl/pipeline.py:239` derives the NFL season as
  `int(target_date.split('-')[0])`, so a January/February playoff slate resolves to the
  *next* season. Confirmed still present. Impact is currently **nil** — every
  `outlier_nfl/external/*` adapter (`ngs`, `pbp`, `schedule`) is a stub returning
  `{"records": []}`, and the call is wrapped in `try/except` with an empty-list fallback. It
  becomes real the moment those adapters are implemented. Fix is a month<=2 → year-1 guard.
- **Still open (from 2026-09-24):** the roster gate's bare-proximity pattern treats an
  *opponent* mention as a violation ("leaky WAS secondary vs Jahan Dotson"). Needs a human
  call on whether opponent context should be exempted.
